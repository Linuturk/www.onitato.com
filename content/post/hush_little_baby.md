My own special version of Hush Little Baby.

> Hush little baby, don't say a word.  
> Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird.
> 
> If that mockingbird doesn't sing,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a golden ring.
> 
> If that golden ring turns brass,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a looking glass.
> 
> If that looking glass does break,  
> daddy's gonna buy you some roller skates.
> 
> If those roller skates make you fall,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a bouncy ball.
> 
> If that bouncy ball goes flat,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a yoga mat.
> 
> If that yoga mat does tear,  
> daddy's gonna buy you some underwear.
> 
> If those underwear start to smell,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a silver bell.
> 
> If that silver bell does crack,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a baseball bat.
> 
> If that baseball bat does miss,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a gold fish.
> 
> If that gold fish does die,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a pumpkin pie.
> 
> If that pumpkin pie's too sweet,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a hunk of meat.
> 
> If that hunk of meat does spoil,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a Tesla coil.
> 
> If that Tesla coil doesn't shock,  
> daddy's gonna buy you a grandfather clock.
> 
> If that grandfather clock breaks down,  
> you're still the sweetest baby in town.
