I was invited to the [Ford F-150 Lightning](https://forddrivetour.com/F-150Lightning/) event here in Denver, CO. I got to ride along in the new Lightning and get an up close and personal look. They also had an [E-Transit](https://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/e-transit/2022/) on site as well.

## Test Ride

Let's start with the most exciting part. After registration, I walked straight over to the test ride tent. Unfortunately, I was prohibited from recording anything inside the vehicle during the test ride. Here's the video of the others taking a test ride:

## Test Ride Prototypes

I was also able to get some pictures of the 3 prototype trucks they were using for the test rides. The three trucks being used were:

* Silver Pro
* Antimatter Blue Pro
* Red XLT
